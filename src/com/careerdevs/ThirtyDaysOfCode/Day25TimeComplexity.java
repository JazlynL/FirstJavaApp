    /* Notes!!!
  Ask developers we ask what is the runtime complexity
  -- how fast is a given function Based on a given input of
  Size N...
  --How Fast the code runs in proportion to its input..
  --
  4 categories of Complexities.
  first running time is
  O (1) -> constant..
  Doesn't depend on the input.

  O(log(n)) -> logrimithic

  O(N) -> linear you go through each element once.

  **the size od the problem is the size of the solution

  input--time
  -----------
   10 // 10 secs
   100 // 100 secs
   1000//1000 secs


  O(n ^2 ) Quadratic (nested for loops)
